# About

👋 Kia Ora, I'm Laura! A New Zealand citizen, based in Tāmaki Makaurau.

🔥 I'm a passionate and dedicated Scrum Master and Product Owner. Leveraging my foundational technical skillset in full stack software engineering, I'm uniquely equipped to connect with, understand, and collaborate effectively with development teams. This journey of upskilling in the technical domain has been instrumental in my quest to be a better team player and gain a deeper comprehension of projects, from conception to fruition.

💬 Eager to explore the intricacies of human dynamics and their impact on professional and interpersonal growth, I'm an insatiable learner. Currently, I'm captivated by translating my therapeutic skillset into leadership practices to enhance team well-being and productivity.

🌱 Rooted in a strong value system that guides me toward the "tech for good" direction, my dynamic and multi-passionate nature fuels my ability to stay focused while offering innovative perspectives.

🚀 I excel at steering projects towards their highest potential, keeping with the vision of stakeholders, while focusing on both project outcomes and individual growth. With experience in waterfall and agile frameworks, I'm able to adapt to various project management approaches.

🌐 In essence, I'm a well-rounded leader poised to infuse my people-first, employee experience passions into teams, creating an environment where everyone thrives. If you'd like to discuss agile, leadership, or anything in between, please feel free to reach out.
